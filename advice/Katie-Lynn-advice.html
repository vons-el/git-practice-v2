      <h2>Try, Try, Again!</h2>
      <p>If things seem easy at first but then become confusing once you're trying to do things on your
        own, don't worry you are not alone! Doing something step-by-step is easy but when doing things on 
        your own, repitition is the key.  
      </p>

      
      <p>I'm not afraid to admit that I did my first project three times before I moved on to the next
        lesson. Even if at first you do succeed, still try try and try it again. By the third time around
        I wasn't even using any of my notes and I created a beautiful website and went on to the bonus 
        lesson to create a second webpage to my site.
      </p>

      <h2>You are human</h2>
      <p>Don't be afraid to take a break. Whether that means a day or 5 days. We are all humans here, not
        robots. Let the knowledge sink into your brain before you jump into another new thing. Rushing things
        is never a good way to learn. That's a huge reason why self-paced programs are so awesome! You don't 
        have to push yourself to learn everything all at one time. The important thing is that you know and 
        understand what you are doing before moving onto something new.
